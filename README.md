# Electricity-Consumption-Analysis
# Data-Driven Analysis of Electricity Consumption

This project analyzes electricity consumption patterns using Python
to support System Dynamics modeling of energy imbalance.

## Objectives
- Identify consumption patterns
- Cluster users based on load behavior
- Provide inputs for dynamic simulation
- Support sustainable energy policy design

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Time Series Analysis
- Data Visualization
